## PIC 10C HW1: Vector Template Class
#### Stella Huang

### Description
This Github repository contains my code to the [first assignment](https://www.pic.ucla.edu/~rsalazar/pic10c/assignments/hw1/) for PIC 10C, Winter 2019 with Prof. Salazar.

  
For this assignment, I have templated the vector class by modifying a provided class definition, found on the [professor's site](https://bitbucket.org/rikis-salazar/10b-hw-pic10b-vector) along with a description of the original assignment.

  
### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is not only to familiarize ourselves with implementing templates, but more importantly to learn to **properly use version control** (i.e. git).

On the repository site, you can click on ['commits'](https://github.com/stehuang/Vector-Class-Template/commits/master) to view my commit history, as well as the branches created. You also can check go to insights, then network to view a [graphical representation of my commit history](https://github.com/stehuang/Vector-Class-Template/network).
